REpresentational State Transfer
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- /Resources/ are identified by a Uniform Resource Locator, or URL.
- A representation of that resource can be retrieved at its URL.
- If the representation is a hypermedia format, it may contain links to other resources that can then be navigated to.
- The representations are self-describing, i.e., no out-of-band information is needed to transition to nearby resources or states.

** Multiple Representations
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- There can be multiple representations of a given resource, e.g., html, csv, json, text, jpg, etc.
- All of them accesible from the one URL
- Content negotiation is used to select the desired one (using the *Accept* HTTP header)

** Hypermedia
#+begin_quote
a nonlinear medium of information that includes graphics, audio, video, plain text and hyperlinks.
