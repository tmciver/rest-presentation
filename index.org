REpresentational State Transfer
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- _Resources_ are identified by a Uniform Resource Locator, or URL.
- A representation of that resource can be retrieved at its URL.
- If the representation is a hypermedia format, it may contain links to other resources that can then be navigated to.
- The representations are self-describing, i.e., no out-of-band information is needed to transition to nearby resources or states.
